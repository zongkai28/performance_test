Performance test plotter
========================

Performance plotter create beautiful reports from performance_test logfiles. It
is a python tool that reads the logfiles and renders PDFs using LaTeX.


Installation
------------

This package requires python3 and texlive. On an Ubuntu system you will need to
install the following packages:

::

   sudo apt-get install python3 texlive texlive-pictures texlive-luatex


Once all dependencies are in place you can setup the plotter using:

::

   pip3 install .


Using
-----

The previous step installed a ``perfplot`` binary, it can be invoked using

::

   perfplot <filename1> <filename2> ...

Be sure to also check ``perfplot -h`` for additional options.

Common Pitfalls
***************

All of the latency metrics are collected and calculated by the subscriber process.
For interprocess communication, it is recommended to provide different prefixes for
the log files:

::

   perf_test -c ROS2 -t Array1k -p 1 -s 0 -l log_pub
   perf_test -c ROS2 -t Array1k -p 0 -s 1 -l log_sub

Then, to plot the latency metrics, invoke perfplot on the subscriber's log file.
If perfplot is invoked on the publisher's log file, then the CPU and memory
metrics will be plotted, but the latency plot will be empty.
   

Jupyter notebook extension
---------------------------

It is also possible to plot the results inside a Jupyter notebook. This allows to plot different
experiments on the same graph.

Installation
*************

The dependencies are loaded inside a Python virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install virtualenv
   cd performance_test/helper_scripts
   python3 -m venv performance_test_plotter_env
   
   # Active the venv
   # Note that the command might differ for your environment
   # See https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments for more info
   source performance_test_plotter_env/bin/activate
   
   # Install requirements
   pip3 install "plotly==4.9.0" "notebook>=5.3" "ipywidgets>=7.2" pandas numpy click
   pip3 install --user ipykernel
   python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=performance_test_plotter_env
   
Using
*****

.. code-block:: bash

   # Open the Jupyter notebook
   jupyter notebook plot_logs.ipynb
   
   # Make sure that the correct kernel is selected: performance_test_plotter_env

   # When you are done, deactivate the venv
   deactivate
